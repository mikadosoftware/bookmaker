misc stuff I will find another place for
========================================

passwords
---------
/etc/passwd is a bit long in the tooth.
/etc/master.passwd is where the action is now kept.
if you look at that and need to, for example, change the login shell
you need to run pwd_mkdb /etc/master.passwd afterwords
