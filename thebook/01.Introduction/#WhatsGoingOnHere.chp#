======================
What is going on here?
======================
I am an IT manager working in the UK. It is my career choice (international movie idol was taken)  and I have made what might be described as a decent go of it, with some success and failures. For a while I have been trying to seperate cause from effect in both those outcomes.
Socrates once said that "the unexamined life is not worth living" [#]_ , which lets face it is pretty harsh, but otherwise good advice (and certainly more practical today than "don't drink the hemlock")

So I have written this:

- part how-to manual, where you can find either fully working applications that could help someone run their own IT department, or articles on setting up webservers and code for monitoring the toner in the office printers.
- part philosophical magazine - articles on how to manage 50-100 interlocking projects, which is about average for even a small IT department, or why I dislike IBM adverts


Its not really a blog, as anything worth saying has rarely suffered from waiting a bit to be said, and its not a book because it is not quite organised as such. 

ANyway, dip in and enjoy, I hope you find some of the views you find here interesting, perhaps even stimulating. And please take the code, read it and maybe contribute back. Take care.
