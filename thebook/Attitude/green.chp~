Its not easy being green
========================


The world is heating up, the mean temperature of the planet will increase 
between 1.5 C and 3 C or more in the next 100 years.
Below 2C only averagely bad things will happen, above it really Bad Things.



However there are two or three approaches, and like all good IT managers I am simplifying for ease

1. Stop using fossil fuels.
2. Reduce the power consumption so it is easier/cheaper to stop using fossil fuels
3. Reduce or replace other pollutants and contaniments in our processes
4. Crow about it in adverts and down the pub. We do not toil to be quiet about our achievements





Electrical power consumption for computing accounts for an estimated 10% of Western power use and is growing
THis is a "good thing" - it means my basic thesis is correct - computers are growing more and more central to our way of life and that good management of computers is better than bad.

Of course its bad in other senses.

Ways to reduce power consumption

THere is one, sure-fire way that leads to a lot of complication.
ANd it has nothing to do with windfarms or solar collectors on the roof of the office.

Stop commuting to the office.

Far and away the best book on this subject (and its free!) is

Sustainable Energy - Without the hot air
David JC MacKay

Much of the intelligent comments in this chapter are stolen shamelessly from him.
