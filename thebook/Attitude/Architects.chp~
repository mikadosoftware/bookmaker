Architects and Town Planners
============================



What is an Enterprise Architect?
What are the keys to EA?

Simplicity - simple enough to be held in one persons head.
If not then need a different approach

Architecture v town planning

TOwn planning is not command and control - but focuses on principles of defined spaces, interaction, constraining types of growth

How to persuae people that they are not that special. That a special case is rarely a good enough explanation for doing it differently.

weaknesses - his premises (stated p.83) are that complexity of a system is related to number of (significant) decision paths a system can take.
Simplicity, and the use of "partitioning" to decide where to cut.
Its a bit like every other architecture book / article - a clarion call to abstraction.

People Procrastinate when asked to think in the abstract - that when asked to think in abstract students procrastinated in their replys to the researchers.
From this reasonable statement flows the generally poor regard in which "Enterprise Architects" are held (that and every TOm DIck and Harry has had some job title inflation)
It works from both ends, but most Architectures are abstract by default, and 


An architecture is an attempt to simplify the real world sufficently to be able to draw out and emphasise what is essential.  It may be the elegant lines that mix inside and outside of a building created around its veranda, it may be the clear directions and flow of an airport that force you through.  But the essential function of an organisation

if an organisation does more than its architecture can simply represent, perhaps it is time to consider "partitioning" that organisaiton - basically splitting it up into two different organisaitons with some shared work.



Town planning is herding cats.  What is and more importantly what is not allowed in functionality of autonomous units, and how those unts are and are not allowed to interact.


Town planning is often about spotting very similar autonomous units and shouting "replace one with functions of both"
TOwn planning is helped enourmously by market forces, where the people living in town will literally vote with their feet which building or route throgh the town they prefer.  Forcing roads through will make a difference but if everyones prefered destinaiton is still down a one way street they will go there.
