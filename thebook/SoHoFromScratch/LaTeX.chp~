LaTeX

LaTeX is an immensely powerful typesetting package. It is not a word processor, and is in many ways superior to any word processing package, except for one thing. It is hard to get started.

I am going to discuss two ways to make that getting started easier

- how to build your own LaTeX class to style reports as you would like them
- how to generate LaTeX documents (and pdfs) straight from text files.

Classes
-------
LaTeX looks like this

::

  \documentclass{article}
  \begin{document}
  Hello World
  \end{document}

Then discuss packages, classes, making pdfs etc.


Getting hold of LaTeX
---------------------


Writing Own class
-----------------
There are two types of file that contain user-defined style information - classes (*.cls) and packages (*.sty).
A package can be included with any kind of class (article, book) and it will work sensibly. It usually includes things like author information.
A class is much harder to work with other classes - a book class will work badly if it tries to coexist with a newsletter class. 

We want a business-report class, that we shall use to define how all the memos and reports we send out to the business shall look. 
It will try and mimic a Word document as corporate style usually gets defined like that.

 


Notes
-----
difference between class and pacakge

classes are in .cls files, and only do one *type* of document (ie newsletter)
packages are in .sty files and have functions that can affect any *type* of document, such as graphics package.

There is a report class defined in /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base, and as I am trying to create my own class that will be used for my internal reports, that is where we start
