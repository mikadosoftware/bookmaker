<p>My view on recent events</p>
<p>1. All very well talking about black swans. We knew, they knew
Bonus culture was in effect &quot;heres other peoples money, you get a cut of your winnings, the casino will close, because the casino closes when the black swan arrives.
Oh by the way, there is a difference between the casino and the bourse. Its just the casino has taken over the hotel.</p>
<p>BTW VaR is not Value. Its money. Not the same thing</p>
<p>But what is economic value?
Imagine stone age man, has to expend calories to find firewood to keep warm.
Starting a fire is a bugger honestly.
But then someone invents a stove.  Amazing. Less calries expended. Energy is saved.  THis is the base measure of economic value - achieving same thing for less energy expenditure. We see this all the time in progress, roads mean less energy per journey etc etc.</p>
<p>but its only one persons energy saved.
So a company that makes stoves for people and sells them will be adding economic value every time.
And then there is the finaciaer. It is important but not that important.
The invetnion is out there, someone will make stoves.</p>
<p>ALl the finciacers do is make sure that company makes them - the econmice value ascribed to that process is a lot smaller than that of making distributing the stuff.</p>
<p>Like roads - important but a small part.</p>
<p>so focus on the important sections -</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>bourse</li>
</ul>
<p>you cannot make money risk free.</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>Whats all this?</h2>
This site is a guide to running an IT department or team.  It about the stuff that you should obviously know, (but can't quite get) like setting up spam filters on mail servers.  Its also about the opinions and attitudes you need, why project management is hard, and why you must read code.  And its about other people in the industry, interviews and feedback.
<p>The examples are all aimed at FreeBSD servers, a solid, dependable OS that can be found in many high end server farms.


<h2><a href="/Introduction/introduction.html">IT matters</a></h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2><a href="/SoHoFromScratch/index.html">SoHo From Scratch</a></h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2><a href="/Attitude/index.html">Beyond Recipies</a></h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2><a href="/OtherPoV/index.html">Other Points of View</a></h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
