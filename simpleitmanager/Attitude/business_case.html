<h2>Why most businesses get it wrong</h2>
<p>Some years ago I worked at the project gateway for a large company. Every project of any appreciable size had to go through the project office to get approval and funding.  And that meant technical analysis and it meant a business case.</p>
<p>One day I heard the comment &quot;Give that to Paul - you want to not do that one, if you want to know why a project won't work he can find a reason&quot;.  Ouch.  Double Ouch.</p>
<p>You see I was being negative.  A sure sign of evil and badness in business, staffed as it is by marketing on a 2 drink minimum, and eternally optimistic entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The problem is, knowing the reasons it wont work is the best way to make sure it will.  Its called science</p>

<h2>Invest in Colombus? No Way.</h2>

In fourteen hundred and ninety-two
Colombus sailed the Ocean blue.

<p>And when he did he proved his critics wrong, the Earth was round not flat and discovered a new continent and riches for all.</p>
<p>Well, actually, thats not true.  Well the bit about sailing across the Atlantic and discovering America is obviously.  But the bit about proving the world was round, and his critics wrong.  Well for that part we need to step back a bit.</p>
<p>Its late 1400's, and Western Europe is just waking up from nearly a millenia of stagnation, science is just starting to overtake the church and contact with</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>Whats all this?</h2>
This site is a guide to running an IT department or team.  It about the stuff that you should obviously know, (but can't quite get) like setting up spam filters on mail servers.  Its also about the opinions and attitudes you need, why project management is hard, and why you must read code.  And its about other people in the industry, interviews and feedback.
<p>The examples are all aimed at FreeBSD servers, a solid, dependable OS that can be found in many high end server farms.


<h2><a href="/Introduction/introduction.html">IT matters</a></h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2><a href="/SoHoFromScratch/index.html">SoHo From Scratch</a></h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2><a href="/Attitude/index.html">Beyond Recipies</a></h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2><a href="/OtherPoV/index.html">Other Points of View</a></h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
