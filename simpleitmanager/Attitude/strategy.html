<h1 class="title">Strategy Thoughts</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle" id="what-is-strategy-and-other-impossible-questions">What is strategy and other impossible questions</h2>
<p>Strategy is like genius. Its an overused word applied to people and things that quite simply are neither.</p>
<p>I am a little bit cynical, yes.</p>
<p>Strategy is such an overused word that I have a little inward groan each time I hear it at work.  It means I will have to work out what the person meant while they sit there thinking that Harvard Business School needs teaching a thing or two.</p>
<p>But by the bye, I have worked some nuggets of gold from the crowded mine.</p>
<div class="section" id="do-you-mean-the-verb-or-the-noun">
<h2>Do you mean the verb or the noun?</h2>
<p>Strategy can be two things - a verb, an action word as I was taught at school. What we are going to do. WHat action will we take. This is strategy as a <em>planned approach</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;what is our printer strategy?&quot;
Well its fairly obvious that how we <em>approach</em> printing, our printing philosophy if you will, is not going to get front page billing in the annual report to shareholders just under the Chairmans comments.  So the word used here is really the &quot;elevator pitch&quot; - tell me in simple terms whay I am going to have a printer on every desk. Or not.  Are we going to turn them off at night, or record who prints what?</p>
<p>Or strategy can be a noun - a name for who we are.  We are a search company, we are going to put a computer on every desktop.  In my view the clearest example of strategy (and mission statements which are just the Proper Noun) is that of ICI <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a>
well into the 1980's ICI's aim was to be</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
the world's leading chemical company, serving companies internationally through the innovative and responsible application of chemistry and related science.  Through achievement of this aim, we will enhance the wealth and wellbeing of our shareholders, our employees, our customers and the communities which we serve and in which we operate
</pre>
<p>Of course that is a name that one can identify with.  As a chemist you can change the world. Want a job?</p>
<p>Now the mission statement looks different:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
creating complex mixtures that deliver the effects valued by consumers and customers

building a portfolio of businesses ... bringing together understanding, outstanding knowledge of customer needs, and lead edge technology platforms
</pre>
<p>Frankly the name no longer means anything. The commitment has gone.  It could mean or do or be anything.</p>
<p>Commitment free is not quite all it is cracked up to be. Without commitment we humans are a poor lot.</p>
<p>Balancing up cost/benefit vs total commitment.
total commitment wins</p>
<p>What is the IT strategy
OK, this probably is not under the CHairmans speech either, but it could be in the annual report.  but what does it mean?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-negative-view">
<h2>The negative view</h2>
<p>Sometimes it is easier to make out shapes and importance by looking at the negative of a photo. and in the same way I think strategy can be determined by what it is not</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
If you realise it was a mistake, and you can get out of it in days or weeks,
it was *tactical*.  If it takes years to get out of it, it was *strategy.*
</pre>
<p>this I find a useful definition - it focuses us on what is essential about strategy - <em>commitment</em>.  It also focuses us on the importance of reducing our commitments down to the ones we really really want to make.</p>
<p>IT can deliver what every man wants - freedom from commitment. OK, it may not be entirely PC (or true) but every business wants to be able to back out of situations cleanly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="commitment">
<h2>Commitment</h2>
<p>The origin of a business as a legal entity is quite interesting, and a good guide to why things work <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a>
However, the essence is that the corporation cam into existence as a means of funding ships to travel to and trade with India, China and America.  They were in all senses of the word, an <em>enterprise</em>.</p>
<p>The sole purpose was to raise cash, build ships, bring back outrageously priced spices, flog them and give back the cash.</p>
<p>The enterprise was, wait for it, totally committed to one process.</p>
<p>It had a strategy.  Go to India, come back rich.  That was all it was todo.
It was easy to decide if it was making a strategic mistake. If it was not getting our ships closer to the spice, it was a mistake.</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>Whats all this?</h2>
This site is a guide to running an IT department or team.  It about the stuff that you should obviously know, (but can't quite get) like setting up spam filters on mail servers.  Its also about the opinions and attitudes you need, why project management is hard, and why you must read code.  And its about other people in the industry, interviews and feedback.
<p>The examples are all aimed at FreeBSD servers, a solid, dependable OS that can be found in many high end server farms.


<h2><a href="/Introduction/introduction.html">IT matters</a></h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2><a href="/SoHoFromScratch/index.html">SoHo From Scratch</a></h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2><a href="/Attitude/index.html">Beyond Recipies</a></h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2><a href="/OtherPoV/index.html">Other Points of View</a></h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
