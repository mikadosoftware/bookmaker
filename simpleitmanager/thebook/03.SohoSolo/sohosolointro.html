<h1 class="title">Introduction to Soho Solo</h1>

<p>I have already argued (convincingly I hope) that to be an IT Manager, one must, like a good chef, already be able to cook at home.  This part of the site is my how-to cook book for IT managers - it starts at how to install a Unix server and goes on to email, firewalls, webserver and file and print.</p>
<p>These are written not entirely from the usual 'do this' aproach - whilst that is necessary, the focus is on making the job of keeping track of the setup easier afterwards.</p>
