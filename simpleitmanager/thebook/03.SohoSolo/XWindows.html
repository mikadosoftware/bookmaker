<h1>X Windows</h1>
<p>X-Windows, otherwise known as just <em>X</em>, is the Unix version of the well-known Windows/Mouse Graphical User Interface.
First developed at Parc-Xerox <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1">[1]</a> the concept of using
overlapping windows, and a 'mouse' is often seen as the <em>only</em> way to interact with a computer.</p>
<p>Of course the unix tradition is for a command line interface - that of typing in commands to a shell,
and is a more powerful way to interact in almost all cases <a href="#id6"><span class="problematic" id="id7"><span id="id2"></span>[#]_</span></a> . X-windows is of course the comic book variant of the command line
that is the normal world of books. However at times comics can replace normal books.</p>
<div class="section" id="installing">
<h2>Installing</h2>
<p>There is a meta-port for X windows. x11/xorg
SImply install this - takes about 6 hours.</p>
<p>Firstly, we are still at the command line when we boot our machine, and after logging in I still
only have the prompt. On a machine that has X installed, we can type</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
startx
</pre>
<p>and up comes the GUI. (to get out of the GUI, use ctl-alt-backspace. This will stop the current X session)</p>
<p>So let us get X installed and running. NB. installing X from Ports takes hours, and if you compile KDE or GNOME
instead of xfce4, you can easily have it running for a full 24 hours. Honest. Try xfce4 for now.</p>

<div class="section" id="initial-configuation">
<h2>Initial Configuation.</h2>
<p>After we have successfully got the meta port above installed we want to configure the X settings. This is firly complex, but
also pretty well automated. All the settings are controlled from one file, xorg.conf, which is usually found in
/usr/local/etc/X11/xorg.conf.  Except that right now there is no such file there. Firstly we create it by getting Xorg to do the hard work:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ Xorg -configure
</pre>
<p>This will automatically scan your hardware and put a config file in /root called xorg.config.new</p>
<p>Try it out - you never know !:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ Xorg -config /root/xorg.config.new
</pre>
<p>You will see a sawtooth background with a X cross in the middle. Try moving the mouse. If the cross moves too,
good. If not, you probably need to enable the mouse daemon. (see sidebar)</p>
<p>More than likely you will have a sawtooth pattern that has lines scanning through it wildly.
This is because the scan and refresh rates that X Windows is trying to use are out of whack with the ones the monitor uses.</p>
<p>DOnt forget - you can &quot;kill&quot; off the X display using ctl-alt-backspace</p>
<p>so, we find the hard part of X windows installation. FInding refresh rates. FOr some reason these are always hard to get
hold of.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="monitor-specs">
<h2>Monitor specs</h2>
<pre class="literal-block">
Before configuration of X11 the following information about the target system is needed:
- Monitor specifications
- Video Adapter chipset
- Video Adapter memory
</pre>
<p>some background
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.monitorworld.com/faq_pages/q10_page.html">http://www.monitorworld.com/faq_pages/q10_page.html</a>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
A monitor's maximum vertical refresh rate is limited by how fast it can direct the electron beam over all of the picture elements on the monitor. This involves moving the electron beam in the same manner as you would read the words in a book, left to right, top to bottom. It is limited by the maximum HSR, which determines the maximum horizontal pixel addressability the monitor can display and the number of scanlines (i.e. vertical addressability). For example, to display a screen with an addressability of 640 pixels horizontally and 480 vertically, a monitor with a HSR of 31.5kHz would take 480/31.5k = 15.2 ms to scan the entire screen once. In one second, this monitor could be refreshed 1000ms/15.2ms = 65.6 times.
However, the vertical sync - movement of the electron gun to the upper left corner of the screen -
requires some time, so the resulting vertical refresh rate is only 60 Hz.
</pre>
<p>A (fair) bit of googleing gets me</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
EDID Name : CAL L15CX (my monitor badge)
Minimum HorizSync : 30.000 kHz
Maximum HorizSync : 60.000 kHz
Minimum VertRefresh : 56 Hz
Maximum VertRefresh : 75 Hz
Maximum PixelClock : 80.000 MHz
Maximum Width : 1024 pixels
Maximum Height : 768 pixels
Preferred Width : 1024 pixels
Preferred Height : 768 pixels
Preferred VertRefresh : 75 Hz
Physical Width : 300 mm
Physical Height : 230 mm
</pre>
<p>SO I want to enter the following</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
HorizSync    30-60
VertRefresh  56-75
</pre>
<p>I try it - and hey presto, the sawtooth is still flickering.
So I play around a bit. Now the lines are rolling up the screen, so I guess it is the vertical refresh rate that is wrong
I constrain the refresh rates, 69-75, 74-75, and then try 70-70. Hey, google is not so useful after all the refresh rate
I found was too high. dropping it down to 70HZ gives me a clear fixed sawtooth. And the manufacturers website has broken links on it
so I fear that unless you buy top quality monitors this sort of problem is always going to be withus.</p>
<p>Please note however, that just typing startx often just works with good enough defaults. The whole thing was usable before
I played around. I just like it so.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
HorizSync    50-60
VertRefresh  56-70

<p>If I dropped the horizontal sync, the vert refresh goes out of whack.</p>

<p>Even though typing on the command line before we run X I can use my keyboard and the characters I expect
appear OK, this is because the OS is reading the line in /etc/rc.conf that says <em>keymap=uk.iso</em>.
Unfortunately X will ignore this and default to some American setting. Which means that <em>&quot;</em> is in the wrong place as is a fair number of other characters.
This is annoying, but luckily we know that here, in xorg.conf are the settings that X will use.</p>
<p>We can see the various options in /usr/local/share/X11/xkb/rules/org.lst
UK is gb.
(Now actually Great Britain is not the same as United Kingdom, and this is one of those internationalisation
problems, that the real world is a lot more complicated than one poor programmer can be bothered to deal with)</p>
