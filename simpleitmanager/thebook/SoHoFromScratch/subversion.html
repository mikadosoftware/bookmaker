<ul>

</ul>
<p>we create a single location for our repository.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
svnadmin create /usr/home/pbrian/repos/PBRIAN
</pre>
<p>set up users and passwords, assuming you use the svnserve daemon which is
a fairly easy network approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;repository&gt;/conf/svnserve.conf
- uncomment the lines below
anon-access = read
auth-access = write
password-db = passwd
realm = paul-brian.com</p>
<p>svnserve -r /usr/home/pbrian/repos -d
svnserve -r /usr/home/pbrian/repos -d --listen-host localhost</p>
</blockquote>
<p>now I should be able to see all that is going on in my repository with</p>
<blockquote>
svn ls svn://localhost/PBRIAN</blockquote>
<p>for debugging the first time, I find the below useful:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
svnserve -r /usr/home/pbrian/repos --listen-host localhost -X
&lt;this listens on my localhost&gt;
</pre>
<p>I do not have to have the svnserve running all the time. in fact it could be a security risk</p>
<div class="section" id="so-far">
<h3>so far</h3>
<p>I have a listening svn daemon on my machine, and a repository.
The svn daemon is listening for all repositorys at /home/pbrian/repos
At the moment only PBRIAN repository exists, so i need to access
the repository as follows</p>
<blockquote>
svn ls svn://localhost/PBRIAN/</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="autostarting">
<h3>Autostarting</h3>
<p>The port has added to /usr/local/etc/rc.d (where startup scripts are kept)
a script <em>svnserve</em></p>
<p>This script has 3 important changes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the path to the repository directory</li>
<li>the user and group svn</li>
</ul>
<p>I shall change the path to the one above. But I need to add a user and group called svn
(it could be anything but that is a sensible default)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pbrianlap# pw group add svn
pbrianlap# pw user add svn -g svn</p>
<p>chown -R svn:svn /usr/home/pbrian/repos/
(this last is easy to forget - svn user needs to be able to write to the repository)</p>

<h3>first time - setting up a working directory</h3>
<p>Firstly - think how you will be setting up the work.
I am writing a book-cum-website. It is fairly linear and simple, so I will
keep to the recommended 'trunk-tag-branch' approach
I cannot imagine having many branches, the book will not diverge a lot, so
I shall create a file struncture as below</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/usr/home/pbrian/thebook
-tags
-trunk</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<tt class="docutils">&lt;string&gt;</tt>, line 90)</p>

<col class="option" />
<col class="description" />
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="option-group">
<kbd><span class="option">-t<var>hebook</var></span></kbd></td>
<td>-introduction.chp</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
svn import thebook svn://localhost/PBRIAN -m 'my first import'
</pre>
<p>you will be asked for you authentication password and username.
these then get cached by svn for next time.</p>

<div class="section" id="directories-and-stuff">
<h3>Directories and stuff</h3>
<p>checkouts can be awkward.
the difference between these two commands for example</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>IT matters</h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2>SoHo From Scratch</h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2>Beyond Recipies</h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2>Other Points of View</h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
