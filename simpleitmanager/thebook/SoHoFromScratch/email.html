<h1 class="title">Email</h1>
<p>Email is the serial-killer app of the Internet, it keeps on being the one thing everyone wants in each generation. It has become part of everyday life and it is vital to manainging correctly.</p>
<p>The standard setup</p>
<p>This is on the mail Transport Agent (MTA). This is the part that recieves the email for final delivery, then puts it into the post box ready to be collected.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>postfix</li>
<li>mailscanner</li>
<li>clam-av</li>
<li>spamassassin</li>
</ul>
<p>This set of four gives us a standard border email server. It will receive mail for a given domain and then prepare those mails for storage and reading.  THis will happen by postfix receving a email via SMTP, then passing it to mailscanner, which is designed to shove emails thorugh various external rograms and return them to the control of postfix. So basically, we shall receive an email in postfix, then pass it around through antivirus and spam checking, then back to postfix.</p>
<p>Further work
We shall also use SASL to ensure SMTP-AUTH is used
we shall also use dovecot to pick up the emails
WE shall also use a side database to capture the emails being put into dovecot
(in other words there will be a maildir and a database probably mysql)</p>
<p>I intend to make this to store emails for later analysis, textual and other.</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>IT matters</h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2>SoHo From Scratch</h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2>Beyond Recipies</h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2>Other Points of View</h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
