<h1 class="title">LaTeX</h1>
<p>LaTeX is an immensely powerful typesetting package. It is not a word processor, and is in many ways superior to any word processing package, except for one thing. It is hard to get started.</p>
<p>I am going to discuss two ways to make that getting started easier</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>how to build your own LaTeX class to style reports as you would like them</li>
<li>how to generate LaTeX documents (and pdfs) straight from text files.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="classes">
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>LaTeX looks like this</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello World
\end{document}
</pre>
<p>Then discuss packages, classes, making pdfs etc.</p>

<h2>Writing Own class</h2>
<p>There are two types of file that contain user-defined style information - classes (<em>.cls) and packages (</em>.sty).
A package can be included with any kind of class (article, book) and it will work sensibly. It usually includes things like author information.
A class is much harder to work with other classes - a book class will work badly if it tries to coexist with a newsletter class.</p>
<p>We want a business-report class, that we shall use to define how all the memos and reports we send out to the business shall look. It will try and mimic a Word document as corporate style usually gets defined like that.</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>IT matters</h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2>SoHo From Scratch</h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2>Beyond Recipies</h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2>Other Points of View</h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
