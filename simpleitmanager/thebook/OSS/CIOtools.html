<h1 class="title">IT Managers Tool Box</h1>
<p>CIOtools is a collective name for a disparate bunch of tools that I have either written or contributed too, or find vey useful and/or necessary to life as an IT Manager.  I suspect it would be better called IT Managers Tool Box.</p>
<div class="section" id="project-portfolio-management">
<h2>Project Portfolio Management</h2>
<p>This is probably the tops - project management is vital, managing a portfolio of projects even more so.</p>
<p>(move to own explanation)</p>
<p>I beleive there are 3 layers of project management for IT</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Business Requirements (Feature Requests)
We are driven by the business requirements (this is <em>not</em> the same as &quot;doing what the business says&quot; nor is it the same as saying &quot;IT does not know what it is doing, please tell us&quot;. These are generally malicious interpretations of a genuine attempt to get a dialog going between IT and &quot;the business&quot;)
This is the level of the CIO</li>
<li>Application Change Requests
(this is the level of the &quot;technology Architect&quot;
Here we</li>
<li>Ticket tracking, cost and effort estimation.</li>
</ol>
<p>We need to recognise that a business owner (non programmer) will have a different (less subtle) view of the technology landscape than us. And that is mostly fine.  The business owner will have a view of many different products that are supported by IT, products like &quot;The HR database&quot; or &quot;the intranet&quot; or &quot;the research application&quot;
These products will mostly but not completely map to real IT applications.  ie Web entry application and report generator application. The two are different and diverse applications,</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>IT matters</h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2>SoHo From Scratch</h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2>Beyond Recipies</h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2>Other Points of View</h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
