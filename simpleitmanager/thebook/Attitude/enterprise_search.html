<p>THis is a fairly big term these days and discussions usually begin like</p>
<p>'humans are more comfortable with the unstructured ordering of information'</p>
<p>and unstructured data is on the rise, enormous numbers fo spreadsheets contain the workings of a company more than the central creaking databases</p>
<p>A bunch of geriatric shoe makers</p>
<p>information is called because it provides a pattern a meaning, usually a predictive pattern</p>
<p>The common Mensa style tests that look like this are informaiton</p>
<p>1 3 5 7 ?</p>
<p>However unstructured information is meaningless. THats like unstrucutred strucutre</p>
<p>unstructured data is feasible. Its called random</p>
<p>We must recognise that all data (apart from random) has structure, and sits on a continuum of 'structuredness'
(define structuredness - structured towards desired usage - this is interesting because it shows why hierarchical databases
lost out to relatioanl - rdbms is less structured than hierarchies - ie can support different views)</p>
<p>so hierarchies close to top
relational
then collective intelligence ranking</p>
<p>basically if the ordering you want is not the way the strucutre currently exists we need to be able to reorder the
data</p>
<p>desktop metaphor has created huge rise in highly strucutred data - ie folders in drives
and people want less structure !!!!</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>IT matters</h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2>SoHo From Scratch</h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2>Beyond Recipies</h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2>Other Points of View</h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
