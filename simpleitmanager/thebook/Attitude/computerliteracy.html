<h1 class="title">computer literacy</h1>
<p>Many company's have policy manuals, and process manuals.
These explain 'how things are done around here'. They are meant to be read by all the members of the organisation so people know what the process is for say, dealing with the incoming raw materials.</p>
<p>Fortunately the days of process manuals seem to be drawing to a close as companies start to autoamte thier processes - the reasons for doing so are usually to increase the comtrol, repeatibility, monitoring and so forth. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>  All of which can be much more effectively done through software.</p>
<p>The only problem is that I expect most people to be able to read the process manual. They might not <em>actually</em> read it, but put a copy in front of them and eventually they will dip in. Its not the same with software. Even if most people have access to the source code, they are unable to read it.</p>
<p>Most people are computer illiterate.</p>
<p>also CEO who cannot read - the memos the company policy the
jane street  - partners unable to reason about the code without lookups - this is where we are heading
it is why programmers get frustrated - imagine being hired to 'write thigns down' but no one will tell you what they want written - at least not in enough detail
or with enough context</p>
<p>so this is where the world bifurcats
the law - where changes are put through huge processes to get anything done</p>
<div class="section" id="thesis">
<h2>thesis</h2>
<p>computer literacy means being able to read and write source code,
Analogy is reading comic books without understanding the words.
It means that comics have become the dominant form of book but that to create your own is hard and there are these weitrd open sourcers writing books without pictures !</p>
<p>the people who have a skill of literacy used to be called scribes - they wrote things down</p>
<p>These days that skill is programming.</p>
<p>Most organisations have their processes, their everyday work mediated by, enabled by computer
It does not matter what someone thinks a process is - it matters what the computer thinks
What the source ocde is. Often I have seen compnies with bg long english manuals
that are supposed to reflect what the prcesses are, but they are not what the computer source ocde says and
so are useless</p>
<p>scribes became lawyers</p>
<p>programmers will become the lawyers of 21C</p>
<p>discuss</p>
<p>defintion of illiteratcy - unable to read or write in a languange
I am spanish illiterate. I am not Python or SQL illiterate</p>
<p>important to teach people to read - as importatnto functionaing of an organisation as it is to democracy. How would your company functions differently if no one could read in it?</p>
<p>What was it like when no one could read - there were specialist 'readers' - or scribes.</p>
<p>IT department are the modern day scribes, and our days should be numbered.</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>IT matters</h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2>SoHo From Scratch</h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2>Beyond Recipies</h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2>Other Points of View</h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
