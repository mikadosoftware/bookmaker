<h1 class="title">What is going on here?</h1>
<p>Let me explain, it may take a minute or so, so please do lean back and relax.</p>
<p>I choose &quot;IT Manager&quot; as a career some time ago <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id1">[*]</a> and I have had my ups and downs, and this site is me, trying to make sense of what happened, what I have learnt, trying to create the reference <em>I</em> would have wanted when I started out.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things I enjoy doing when I am not working, is cooking, and a while back I learnt to cook a &quot;proper&quot; risotto. I stood over the pot, Jamie Oliver propped up on the scales, slowly ladling in stock and testing the &quot;bite&quot; of the rice every few minutes.  I make a fairly decent risotto if I do say so, and I had the technical part down.  But one thing always bothered me - it would take me a good hour to cook a risotto, but at a restaurant, they could turn around my dish in ten minutes.</p>
<p>It seemed like they knew a way to cook rice that I did not, some secret, professional, method.</p>
<div class="section" id="trade-secrets-matter">
<h2>Trade Secrets Matter</h2>
<p>Eventually I found another cookbook that explained how &quot;real&quot; restaurants cook the base the day before, stop just as it gets al-dente and cool off the rice.  Then when I place my order it can be whipped out of the fridge and used as a base for piping hot risotto.</p>
<p>Several questions came to mind. <em>&quot;Why didn't you mention that first time around? I thought I was doing it wrong.&quot;</em> was high on the list.
But deeper than that was the realisation that every profession or craft has these hidden tips - <em>trade secrets</em> if you will.</p>
<p>And running a company's IT is no different - there are technical skills, and there is tradecraft. The attitude, approach and organisation that is the difference between talented amateur and professional.</p>
<p>Jamie Oliver did not mention it first time because he was aiming his book at people who will cook at home for their friends.
The writers of most IT books are similarly aimed - not at the IT manager who has to work out how to fit all this in, but at the much more numerous &quot;professional programmer&quot;.  Just as Jamie Oliver's book will teach you to cook but not how to be a chef, most books on IT will teach you to write a unittest, but not how to organise the writing of 1,000 tests <em>at the same time</em> as having to replace that old email system.</p>
<p>Most IT managers are thrown in at the deep end - and it is amazing more IT projects do not fail under those circumstances. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2">[1]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="it-matters">
<h2>It Matters</h2>
<p>And I believe that these things matter.  Computers and programming have given the world <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3">[2]</a>  the most flexible human tool ever, and one that will undoubtedly change our world.</p>
<p>And that changing world will need guiding and humanising by people at or near the top of organisations and instituions - in other words, us, IT managers.  And we are needed - badly done, automation can dehumanise the workplace, killing productivity as well as our souls.</p>
<p>So I wanted to write a something, book, site, blog containing the tricks of the trade.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>SoHo From Scratch</em>, which is closest to a traditional &quot;how-to&quot;.  I strongly belive you cannot &quot;manage&quot; a job you cannot do, and so every IT manager should be able to program a computer with a &quot;real&quot; language, and administer a simple SoHo network.</li>
<li><em>Trade Secrets</em>, which is supposed to be the insights I have gleaned from years in the trenches, and probably will look like wild-eyed ranting to everyone else, and</li>
<li><em>Other Points of View</em>, which I am hoping to expand slowly with interviews and thoughts from other IT managers in the industry, providing a rounded view on my ranting. Or possibly just other people ranting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, dip in and enjoy, I hope you find some of the views you find here interesting, perhaps even stimulating.</p>
<p>Take care, but just don't order fish on a Monday.</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>IT matters</h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2>SoHo From Scratch</h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2>Beyond Recipies</h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2>Other Points of View</h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
