<h1 class="title">computer literacy</h1>

<p>Many company's have policy manuals, and process manuals.
These explain 'how things are done around here'. They are meant to be read by all the members of the organisation so people know what the process is for say, dealing with the incoming raw materials.</p>
<p>Fortunately the days of process manuals seem to be drawing to a close as companies start to autoamte thier processes - the reasons for doing so are usually to increase the comtrol, repeatibility, monitoring and so forth. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>  All of which can be much more effectively done through software.</p>
<p>The only problem is that I expect most people to be able to read the process manual. They might not <em>actually</em> read it, but put a copy in front of them and eventually they will dip in. Its not the same with software. Even if most people have access to the source code, they are unable to read it.</p>
<p>Most people are computer illiterate.</p>

<p>defintion of illiteratcy - unable to read or write in a languange
I am spanish illiterate. I am not Python or SQL illiterate</p>
<p>important to teach people to read - as importatnto functionaing of an organisation as it is to democracy. How would your company functions differently if no one could read in it?</p>
<p>What was it like when no one could read - there were specialist 'readers' - or scribes.</p>
<p>IT department are the modern day scribes, and our days should be numbered.</p>
