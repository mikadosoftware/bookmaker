<p>Towards open source ERP, that is ERP that you can damn well understand
The idea is to release not perfect poliched work, but to release work that is an explanation,
and that a programmer can take and add to their own needs.
This is philosophy of releasing work - it is also good for a lazy person.</p>
<p>Open source is an explanation
Software is a representation of human thinking in code form, so it should be understandable
We are representing the company and how it thinks in code. So it should not be confusing, or hidden</p>
