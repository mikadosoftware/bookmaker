<p>THis is a fairly big term these days and discussions usually begin like</p>
<p>'humans are more comfortable with the unstructured ordering of information'</p>
<p>and unstructured data is on the rise, enormous numbers fo spreadsheets contain the workings of a company more than the central creaking databases</p>
<p>A bunch of geriatric shoe makers</p>
<p>information is called because it provides a pattern a meaning, usually a predictive pattern</p>
<p>The common Mensa style tests that look like this are informaiton</p>
<p>1 3 5 7 ?</p>
<p>However unstructured information is meaningless. THats like unstrucutred strucutre</p>
<p>unstructured data is feasible. Its called random</p>
<p>We must recognise that all data (apart from random) has structure, and sits on a continuum of 'structuredness'
(define structuredness - structured towards desired usage - this is interesting because it shows why hierarchical databases
lost out to relatioanl - rdbms is less structured than hierarchies - ie can support different views)</p>
<p>so hierarchies close to top
relational
then collective intelligence ranking</p>
<p>basically if the ordering you want is not the way the strucutre currently exists we need to be able to reorder the
data</p>
<p>desktop metaphor has created huge rise in highly strucutred data - ie folders in drives
and people want less structure !!!!</p>
