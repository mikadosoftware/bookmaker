<h1>Power, Cooling and network hardware</h1>
<p>OK, I have a set of servers running in my office, they throw out a great deal of heat
(a Pentium 4 CPU can run at upto 90C, although it obviously does not last long). So in essence we are running
and office full of bar heaters.</p>
<p>We therefore want to run the servers, and then take the excess heat and throw it outside the office
(environment, schemvironment !)</p>
<p>So, firstly how much electricity do i need
Then how much cooling</p>
<p>Its all down to Watts</p>
<p>1 watt is a rate of power consumption equal to 1 joule per second</p>
<p>Q.      How do I convert Kilowatts (kW) into British thermal unit (Btu)?
A.      To convert Kilowatts (kW) into a British thermal unit (Btu) value simply multiply the Kilowatts value by 3414</p>
<p>kW x 3414 = Btu</p>
<p>OR from wikipedia</p>
<p>1 watt is approximately 3.41 BTU/h
(presumably they mean 1 watt hour is about 3.41 BTU hours)</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>on average a single server will consume 60-120W (yes that is a big varience, but dual cores and load all make a difference.</dt>
<dd>Measure it using a kill-a-watt meter for ease)</dd>

<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: WARNING/2 (<tt class="docutils">thebook/02.unfinished/cabling_hardware.chp</tt>, line 40)</p>
Definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.</div>
<p>.</p>
<p>so, 120 W = 120*3.41 = 409 BTU for a single server
So, 15 servers, all running at once will pump out about 9000 BTU
9000 BTU is the bottom end rating for a DIY air conditioner.
Do  you see where we are going</p>
<p>So if I have a 6000 BTU rated air conditioner I can in theory have 30 servers on at full blast and
the temperature will stay the same</p>
<p>Of course that is not what we want.</p>

<div class="section" id="power">
<h1>power</h1>
<p>In UK electrical power is transmitted to your office in a 3 phase system - the three phases being
&quot;like&quot; sine waves, each of the three is 120 degrees out of step with the other (360 degrees in toto)</p>
<p>that is 3 wires, one at 0 degrees, one at 120, one at 240 degrees.</p>
<p>This means that for every 1/3 of the period over which power is delivered, there is something
deliveirng peak power.</p>

<p>Measure it - buy a plug in kill-a-watt meter
