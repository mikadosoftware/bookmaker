<h2>Wrong, and not wrong</h2>
<p>Most people think the world is a place of grey, uncertain moral and value judgements where somethings depend
greatly on your point of view. Of course very few people think everything depends on your point of view (its very
hard to have a grey area of paedophilia for example) and equally few people feel nothing is realtive, that God or
who ever has already laid down all you need to know.</p>
<p>Given this is it strange that most businesses seem to think that a project is a success or a failure, a contributr to the
bottom line or not.</p>
<p>I prefer, instrad of the right or wrong judegemtn to have 4 categories instead of two</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Right</li>
<li>Not Wrong</li>
<li>Wrong</li>
<li>Not even wrong</li>
</ul>
<p>Right is the best possible choice and outcome. It is the superlative option, the Van Gogh cornfields, the Da Vinci sketch.
It is also nearly impossible to judge at the moment - the passage of time, comparison to many other alternatives is usually
needed to be sure it was Right.</p>
<p>Not Even Wrong is a phrase coined by the German Phyisicist (xxx) - he was commenting on the work of a student with a certain
lack of tact, and made it clear that the student had not simply got his answer wrong, but that he had been working in the wrong directions. Its a little like my Maths O levels, where I was expected to 'show my workings' so that even if my long division failed me I would still get points for trying to divide the right fractions.</p>
<p>THis concept gives us a look at the ideas of Not Wrong. If right is the artisitically correct, perfect version  then
there are others that are also close to perfect - constables sketches, Turner as a scultptor. THese are things that will not be world class, but are the poutput of talented professionsal with true skill.
Not wrong is where we have tried to divide the correct fractions, and got our division correct. Its just that we could have used calculus.</p>
<p>Wrong is where our long division failed us. We can at the time see that worng is wrong. We, or perhpas a professional IT manager
would say ' THat is not how I want it because that will lead to problems'</p>

<p>Both changed the world, but ONLY when everyone[1] started to do it</p>

<p>not understanding technology makes ou an ELoi, ignoring the real world

<p>we must understandintechnology, how we go from energy to use,
how we can use it to survive, grow and do less damage.</p>
<p>less damage - the pest contorl version - cynaide pellets, DDT, GMO - each less violent.</p>
<p>Thinking <em>is</em> innovative. And lets face it, in the stone age would you like to have a book on emaotuions or a book on
science</p>
<p>if we think about it, the writing analogy is truly forceful - would we consider it sensible that todays business
hires a team of writers everytime they want to write something down.?</p>
<p>THis in many ways used to be the stenopool, the bookmaker/accountant/dataentry, or the scribe.
What happened to them, what technological or social shifts moved them out?
THe hancock replaced by Lyons, the stenopool, replaced by cost of typist vs cost of PA.
The stenopool became PA, organisers, project mgrs.</p>
<p>The scribe. They became lawyers.</p>
<p>What will become of a society that has rules codified in a way only the computer can understand. We will need a profession
that can be trusted to write things down, the rules of society.</p>

<h2>Understanding technology</h2>

<div class="section" id="its-all-about-programming">
<h2>Its all about programming</h2>
<p>Computers are there for programming, for computing the codified, straitjacketed expression of human intelligence known as source code.
These computers are for programming as paper is for writing. We do not hand our teenagers pen and paper and congratulate them
as 'paper-literate' if they are able to fold an aeroplane, or doodle a recognisable tree.
the very nature of writing is its value, its ability to express and communicate
across time and space. A program can do the same and more. Its expressiveness
can be greater, as it allows a recursion and growth that makes infinity seem podgy and small.</p>
<p>Books can take us out of ourselves and into the world, whereas a program can take us inside itself.</p>
<p>Where this new world will leave us all I do not know.  Its up to our children to find out. But we must ensure they are
truly programming-literate.</p>
<p>I used to use driving as a metaphor for programming - that we would look at someone
who could not program in same way as someone who could not drive. Askance, unusual.
But I believe the change is deeper. being able to use a car, let us say drive safely,
is similar to being able to use Microsoft Office, the current standard for computer-literate
the European COmputer Drivign licence.</p>
<p>However it seems to go beyond that, someone is not considered literate if able to
fold paper.</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>Whats all this?</h2>
This site is a guide to running an IT department or team.  It about the stuff that you should obviously know, (but can't quite get) like setting up spam filters on mail servers.  Its also about the opinions and attitudes you need, why project management is hard, and why you must read code.  And its about other people in the industry, interviews and feedback.
<p>The examples are all aimed at FreeBSD servers, a solid, dependable OS that can be found in many high end server farms.


<h2><a href="/Introduction/introduction.html">IT matters</a></h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2><a href="/SoHoFromScratch/index.html">SoHo From Scratch</a></h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2><a href="/Attitude/index.html">Beyond Recipies</a></h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2><a href="/OtherPoV/index.html">Other Points of View</a></h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
