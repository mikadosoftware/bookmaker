<p>SUggests that it is not rationally worth voting because of the very low likelihood that your vote will influence the outcome.</p>
<p>THis is not valid, for same reason as vaccination.  I rationally might not choose to get vaccinated because of the very low likelihood that (if everyone else gets vaccinated) I will catch the disease.</p>
<p>However if everyone thinks like me we will have an epidemic</p>
<p>I choose to vote not because I think I will be able to decide who gets to be the next president.  I vote so that I vaccinate my society against the extremist viruses.  I know i cannot affect whether David Cameron or GOrdon Brown gets in.  I do have preferences, but either of them is a far far better option than the head of the BNP or the socialst workers party, or some other non mainstream choice.</p>
<p>We live in mainstream for so long we do tend to forget the wild wild oceans out there.</p>
<p>This does explain other rational behaviour - like selection boards.  A group of blue rinse tories not choosing young gifted blacks may look like simple bigotry (and indeed it may be) but if they like me realise that the chances of their choice actually affecting national politics is quite low, then instead of MP selection boards aiming to choose the best chance for government, they instead ensure they keep out crackpots.  And the best way to choose someone who is not a crackpot, is to choose someone like yourself.  (Which assumes you yourself are not a crackpot, and may be a stretch if you have seen a selection board)</p>
<p>So it may not be rational to become informed</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>Whats all this?</h2>
This site is a guide to running an IT department or team.  It about the stuff that you should obviously know, (but can't quite get) like setting up spam filters on mail servers.  Its also about the opinions and attitudes you need, why project management is hard, and why you must read code.  And its about other people in the industry, interviews and feedback.
<p>The examples are all aimed at FreeBSD servers, a solid, dependable OS that can be found in many high end server farms.


<h2><a href="/Introduction/introduction.html">IT matters</a></h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2><a href="/SoHoFromScratch/index.html">SoHo From Scratch</a></h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2><a href="/Attitude/index.html">Beyond Recipies</a></h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2><a href="/OtherPoV/index.html">Other Points of View</a></h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
