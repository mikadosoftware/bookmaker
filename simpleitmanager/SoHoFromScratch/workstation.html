<h2>Tuning your PC to be &quot;Just So&quot;</h2>
<p>This might start to get a little nerd-like.  Oh hell, a lot nerd-like but I spend the majority of my working life in front of my PC, so it had better act like I want it to act.</p>
<p>We <em>knowledge workers</em> (no laughing at the back there) use computers everyday, but how we use them is a mark of our effectiveness <em>as</em> knowledge workers.  I reckon there are four levels at which we can use a computing device <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Dumb terminal</li>
<li>Gadgets and knobs</li>
<li>Tool use</li>
<li>Tool creation</li>
</ul>
<p>Dumb terminals I deal with elsewhere.</p>
<div class="section" id="gadgets-and-knobs">
<h3>Gadgets and knobs</h3>
<p>This is the screensaver and ringtone level of personalisation.  I am using the PC as a gadget, and I dont know or care how to progress further.  I fear this is not an uncommon situation.  Most computing devices are just gadgets not programming platforms (not withstanding iPhone).  And even when they are programming platforms it just seems they are designed to stop people from starting to program.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tool-use">
<h3>Tool use</h3>
<p>Think photoshop or GIMP here.  These, whilst programmable, simply are not used as programming platforms by the users.  But they are not by any stretch gadgets - that carries a perjorative that you just cannot use for something as deep and complex as Photoshop.  It is a tool, and frankly one that I have considerable admiration for the developers and anyone who can use it more effectively than me (which is probably every six-year old and up)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tool-creation">
<h3>TOol creation</h3>
<p>No, I am not talking about writing you own photoshop, but perhaps a toolchanin ivolving photoshop, or a email procmail or ....
Programming involves the things we want to manipulate having a manipulabe part - it is represented in some form in the virtual world, and the knwoledge it can be manipulated, and then the ability to manipulate.</p>
<p>Availability, Awareness, Ability.</p>
<p>There is some sort of principle here, one that harks back to my original thesis of programming as the be all and end all of computing.  Basically</p>
<p>Gadgets, knobs, application tuning
Tool use,
tool creation</p>
<p>First and foremost, I should be able to extend my PC - by that I mean I should be able</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dumb-terminal">
<h3>Dumb terminal</h3>
<p>I think I am one of my own worst offenders here.  Giving &quot;users&quot; dumb terminals is probably the simplest and easiest forms of IT management around.  It is cheap(er), easy to implement and reduces the variables people have to play around with, thus reducing my headaches.  But I am supposed to be championing the use of programming as a fundamental skill in the 21st Century.  So I do this by taking away from people's personal computing.  I am not entirely clear I have resolved this, but I make programming available on the terminals, mostly SQL query browser, so I can assuage my guilt.</p>

<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>Yeah, computing device.  I have a phone that is more powerful than most PCs I ever used, and I can barely get some programs to run on it.  These too need to stop being gadgets and become tools, but I despair of that one happening.  Ten thousand downloads from the iPhone AppStore will not mean you can change it to do what you want.</td></tr>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>Whats all this?</h2>
This site is a guide to running an IT department or team.  It about the stuff that you should obviously know, (but can't quite get) like setting up spam filters on mail servers.  Its also about the opinions and attitudes you need, why project management is hard, and why you must read code.  And its about other people in the industry, interviews and feedback.
<p>The examples are all aimed at FreeBSD servers, a solid, dependable OS that can be found in many high end server farms.


<h2><a href="/Introduction/introduction.html">IT matters</a></h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2><a href="/SoHoFromScratch/index.html">SoHo From Scratch</a></h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2><a href="/Attitude/index.html">Beyond Recipies</a></h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2><a href="/OtherPoV/index.html">Other Points of View</a></h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
