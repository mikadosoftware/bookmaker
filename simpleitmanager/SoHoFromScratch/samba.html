<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[global]
    workgroup = PIRC
    server string = NAGIOS SMB Server
    security = share
    log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
    max log size = 50
    dns proxy = no
    guest account = guest
    unix extensions = off

[install]
    comment  = Unattended
    writable = yes
    locking  = no
    path     = /usr/local/PIRC/w32install/install
    guest ok = yes

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">The above file has</p>
<blockquote>
<p>guest account = guest</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But that account (guest) did not exist on my Box so I got</p>
<blockquote>
tail /var/log/samba/log.smbd</blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>[2008/01/13 22:56:38, 0] smbd/server.c:main(1059)</dt>
<dd>ERROR: failed to setup guest info.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Interestingly I want to view the source itself  so
/usr/ports/distfiles holds all the tarballs, expand and have a look</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>Whats all this?</h2>
This site is a guide to running an IT department or team.  It about the stuff that you should obviously know, (but can't quite get) like setting up spam filters on mail servers.  Its also about the opinions and attitudes you need, why project management is hard, and why you must read code.  And its about other people in the industry, interviews and feedback.
<p>The examples are all aimed at FreeBSD servers, a solid, dependable OS that can be found in many high end server farms.


<h2><a href="/Introduction/introduction.html">IT matters</a></h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2><a href="/SoHoFromScratch/index.html">SoHo From Scratch</a></h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2><a href="/Attitude/index.html">Beyond Recipies</a></h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2><a href="/OtherPoV/index.html">Other Points of View</a></h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
