<p>WOrks fine. However if you rebuild a machine regularly (you <em>can</em> build one
from scratch cant you:-), it is a lot faster to download locally.</p>
<p>So we start up net/cvsup-mirror
THis is a mirror of the cvs sites you normally find on the Internet.
It can contain all the revisions of the source and the current ports tree
so in theory you can build a 4.3 release version of BSD from you r local store</p>
<p>But we dont want to - we just want a fast local up to date copy of the
source and ports trees.</p>
<p>make install clean on net/cvsup-mirror.  Then answer the questions.
Avoid taking things like the web and really avoid the mailing lists.
Too big and unnecessary.
At the time of writing the ports and sources bit is about 3.5G.
THe first download will take a while.</p>
<p>Then alter __ /usr/local/etc/cvsup/cvsupd.access __</p>
<p>We want to add</p>
<blockquote>
+10.137.0.0/16</blockquote>
<p>Then ensure cvsup and cvsupin are in the /etc/passwd</p>
<p>Also check</p>
<p>/etc/rc.conf</p>
<p>cvsupd_enable=&quot;YES&quot;</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>Whats all this?</h2>
This site is a guide to running an IT department or team.  It about the stuff that you should obviously know, (but can't quite get) like setting up spam filters on mail servers.  Its also about the opinions and attitudes you need, why project management is hard, and why you must read code.  And its about other people in the industry, interviews and feedback.
<p>The examples are all aimed at FreeBSD servers, a solid, dependable OS that can be found in many high end server farms.


<h2><a href="/Introduction/introduction.html">IT matters</a></h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2><a href="/SoHoFromScratch/index.html">SoHo From Scratch</a></h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2><a href="/Attitude/index.html">Beyond Recipies</a></h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2><a href="/OtherPoV/index.html">Other Points of View</a></h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
