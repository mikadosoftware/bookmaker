<h2>Debugging C/C++ programs</h2>
<p>SOmetimes a program dies, and leaves a file of its last memory state.
Using the gdb debugger we can see what happened</p>
<p>recently I installed firefox 3 from ports. Then it died when I tried printing.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$gdb core firefox-bin.core

This GDB was configured as &quot;i386-marcel-freebsd&quot;...core: No such file or directory.

Core was generated by `firefox-bin'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x299c5c0b in ?? ()
</pre>
<p>The problem here is the last call made before everything went blooey was in memory address  0x299c5c0b (Hex for 698113035). unfortunately if this binary had been compiled with debugging symbols I could see the name of that function not ??</p>
<p>Normally bt (backtrace) would help but it is useless too...</p>
<p>so I recompiled firefox with debugging symbols, and tried to break it again.
(I altered the options file in /var/db/ports/firefox3/ - WITHOUT_DEBUG=false. Yes double megatives do not help my mental state right now)</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>Whats all this?</h2>
This site is a guide to running an IT department or team.  It about the stuff that you should obviously know, (but can't quite get) like setting up spam filters on mail servers.  Its also about the opinions and attitudes you need, why project management is hard, and why you must read code.  And its about other people in the industry, interviews and feedback.
<p>The examples are all aimed at FreeBSD servers, a solid, dependable OS that can be found in many high end server farms.


<h2><a href="/Introduction/introduction.html">IT matters</a></h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2><a href="/SoHoFromScratch/index.html">SoHo From Scratch</a></h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2><a href="/Attitude/index.html">Beyond Recipies</a></h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2><a href="/OtherPoV/index.html">Other Points of View</a></h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
