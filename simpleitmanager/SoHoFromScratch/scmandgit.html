v good on setting up git</p>
<p>basics - we create a remote &quot;bare&quot; repository - that is a .git directory
- we tell our .git/config file of a ref as url
- we push to that remote repo
- we can then clone that repo and then pull down regularly.  We find that origin
has been defined already for us.</p>

<h2>Two worlds of source control</h2>
<p>There are two worlds of source control, probably best typified by two Open Source products - svn and git.</p>
<p>The major difference is <em>not</em> distributed but how they treat the idea of a master or trunk. Whilst both systems <em>can</em> work in</p>
<p>The simple approach - the master branch is <em>always</em> stable. It is ready to run.
Some people advocate using the trunk as the main development location.
This is wrong. Use the trunk as the point at which approved changes are brought in</p>
<p>process like</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>create branch from the stable master explicitly in order to work on a specific milestone.</li>
<li>all changes are made in the branch.</li>
<li>If you have &quot;been away&quot; from the branch too long, you should have divided up the milestone into smaller deliverables (see Option Theory)</li>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>Whats all this?</h2>
This site is a guide to running an IT department or team.  It about the stuff that you should obviously know, (but can't quite get) like setting up spam filters on mail servers.  Its also about the opinions and attitudes you need, why project management is hard, and why you must read code.  And its about other people in the industry, interviews and feedback.
<p>The examples are all aimed at FreeBSD servers, a solid, dependable OS that can be found in many high end server farms.


<h2><a href="/Introduction/introduction.html">IT matters</a></h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2><a href="/SoHoFromScratch/index.html">SoHo From Scratch</a></h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2><a href="/Attitude/index.html">Beyond Recipies</a></h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2><a href="/OtherPoV/index.html">Other Points of View</a></h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
