<h1 class="title">LaTeX and ReST</h1>
<p>LaTeX is an immensely powerful typesetting package.  It is not a word processor.  It takes &quot;plain&quot; text and it works out the best way to present that text as a book or report or article.  It is used to produce truly beautiful layout, and more importantly, it allows, no, it makes you focus on the words, on what you are going to say.  I find it in many ways superior to any word processing package, except for one thing. It is hard to get started.</p>
<p>So here is my guide to getting started with LaTeX.</p>
<p>Firstly a list of reasons why to use LaTeX.  Its always good to have reasons to sustain you through the dark times.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>LaTeX is used by some of the cleverest people I know, and some of the cleverest people on the planet.  It is to all intents and purposes the language scientists learn to write their doctoral thesis, and publish their papers in journals.</li>
<li>If LaTeX had been around in 1905, Einstein would have used it to typeset his theories on relativity, nature of light and the size of atoms. Of course he would have had to take six months to learn it and then get that last annoying tweak out and a revolution in science would have had to wait another year, but <em>he still would have used LaTeX</em>. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a></li>
<li>It is based on TeX, which was written by Prof. Donald Knuth 30 years ago, and it is still going strong.</li>
<li>TeX has a version numbering system that is tending to pi - in other words we are at version 3.14152.  If that is not cool I do not know what is.</li>
<li>It is pronounced Lay-Tech.</li>
</ul>
<p>and some more serious reasons</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You write a text file, and concentrate on the meaning.  LaTeX makes you look good.</li>
<li>The output looks better.  It just does.  And you can make it even better.  You.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, so there is some clever LaTeX language which does typesetting.  But <em>writing</em> LaTeX is as horrible as writing HTML.  Yes, this is true, and luckily I do not do that.  Some clever people have written a Python suite called docutils, which basically takes text that is formatted in consistent manner, and can turn that into HTML or LaTeX.  Then you can turn that LaTeX into a pdf.</p>
<p>I use ReST, which is a &quot;lite&quot; markup language.  This whole site was written in it.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
This is a Title in ReST
=======================
This is just a paragraph, and below is a bullet list

- with bullet points
- laid out easily
- in any text editor.

and you can even include images.
</pre>
<p>ReST is exceptionally flexible, and you can produce HTML at the drop of a hat:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ rst2html.py --stylesheet=style.css test.txt &gt; test.html
</pre>
<p>And of course it can do the same with LaTeX:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ rst2latex.py test.txt &gt; test.ltx
</pre>
<p>Which you can then convert into a pdf:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ pdflatex test.ltx
</pre>
<p>Now unfortunately this looks, well, a little uninspiring</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="../img/file.jpg" class="screenshot" src="../img/file.jpg" style="width: 178px; height: 240px;" />
<p class="caption">A screen shot of the simple pdf produced above</p>
</div>
<p>The LaTeX equivalent of the above ReST is  (some lines removed (...) for clarity)</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
\documentclass[10pt,a4paper,english]{article}
...
\usepackage{graphicx}
...
\title{This is a Title in ReST}
\author{}
\date{}
\hypersetup{
pdftitle={This is a Title in ReST}
}
\raggedbottom
\begin{document}
\maketitle

...

\end{document}
</pre>
<p>OK, we can take a simple piece of text, run it into LaTeX, run the LaTeX into PDF.  But can we make it look, well, more corporatey.</p>
<div class="section" id="syling">
<h2>Syling</h2>
<p>Frankly only a PhD dissertation committee could love that output.  It is just not, well, jazzy enough these days.  A lot of LaTeX purists (who also happen to be leading experts in typesetting and information presentation, but what do they know),  feel that the over-styling of modern documents tends to lose the content being discussed.  This is probably true but if you work in almost any business these days, they have a corporate style, and you will have no end of trouble fighting it so go with the flow.</p>
<p>My company had requirements for 12pt arial, title pages, headers and footers etc.  But I have this nice workflow that produces pdf outputs - how can I get the corporate styles I need without hand editing the LaTeX documents.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stylesheets-for-latex">
<h2>Stylesheets for LaTeX</h2>
<p>This is where .sty documents come in.  A .sty document is called a <em>Package</em> in LaTeX, but obviously has its roots in <em>style</em> (hence the .sty).  A LaTeX style file can be thought of like CSS for HTML.  Although .sty files also provide real functionality (the graphicx package is hugely complicated), for our purposes just getting to 12pt Arial is enough.</p>
<p>So I need to include this line in my LaTeX document <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
\usepackage{pbrian}
</pre>
<p>and suddenly, with no other changes to the LaTeX, the document looks much better</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="../img/file2-0.jpg" class="screenshot" src="../img/file2-0.jpg" style="width: 178px; height: 240px;" />
<p class="caption">A screen shot of the same LaTeX, but with stylesheet.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="../img/file2-1.jpg" class="screenshot" src="../img/file2-1.jpg" style="width: 178px; height: 240px;" />
<p class="caption">Page 2 of above</p>
</div>
<p>And hey presto ! HTML and PDFs from just text documents. Perfect for knocking up documentation, business reports and the like.</p>
<div class="section" id="corporate-style">
<h3>Corporate Style</h3>
<p>Which is of course exactly what I use this stuff for.  Mostly producing business reports and other &quot;corporate&quot; documents.
It means I can concentrate on the words, and not have to fuss around with making it look nice.</p>
<p>It feels deeply effective to be able to write just some plain vanilla text, hit a command and view a professional looking, impressive document that can be mailed to whoever needs it.  Quotes, proposals, tenders, political in-fighting.  All of which I can concentrate on the <em>content</em> of the document, and then let ReST and LaTeX make me look good.</p>
<p>Of course one can use MS Word (or any word processor) effectively and well,[#]_  but I have found this a indispensible tool.  Often I can find myself where Word is impractical (say on the tube with just a PDA) and just write an email to myself, in plain text, confident that when i am in front of a real computer, it will be a matter of minutes to turn it into a professional document.</p>
<p>Of course two issues stand out.</p>
<p>Now stylesheets are what we are talking about.  HTML has CSS for its style</p>
<p>I am going to discuss two ways to make that getting started easier</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>how to build your own LaTeX class to style reports as you would like them</li>
<li>how to generate LaTeX documents (and pdfs) straight from text files.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="classes">
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>LaTeX looks like this</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello World
\end{document}
</pre>
<p>Then discuss packages, classes, making pdfs etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-hold-of-latex">
<h2>Getting hold of LaTeX</h2>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing-own-class">
<h2>Writing Own class</h2>
<p>There are two types of file that contain user-defined style information - classes (<em>.cls) and packages (</em>.sty).
A package can be included with any kind of class (article, book) and it will work sensibly. It usually includes things like author information.
A class is much harder to work with other classes - a book class will work badly if it tries to coexist with a newsletter class.</p>
<p>We want a business-report class, that we shall use to define how all the memos and reports we send out to the business shall look.
It will try and mimic a Word document as corporate style usually gets defined like that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notes">
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>difference between class and pacakge</p>
<p>classes are in .cls files, and only do one <em>type</em> of document (ie newsletter)
packages are in .sty files and have functions that can affect any <em>type</em> of document, such as graphics package.</p>
<p>There is a report class defined in /usr/local/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base, and as I am trying to create my own class that will be used for my internal reports, that is where we start</p>

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>Whats all this?</h2>
This site is a guide to running an IT department or team.  It about the stuff that you should obviously know, (but can't quite get) like setting up spam filters on mail servers.  Its also about the opinions and attitudes you need, why project management is hard, and why you must read code.  And its about other people in the industry, interviews and feedback.
<p>The examples are all aimed at FreeBSD servers, a solid, dependable OS that can be found in many high end server farms.


<h2><a href="/Introduction/introduction.html">IT matters</a></h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2><a href="/SoHoFromScratch/index.html">SoHo From Scratch</a></h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2><a href="/Attitude/index.html">Beyond Recipies</a></h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2><a href="/OtherPoV/index.html">Other Points of View</a></h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
