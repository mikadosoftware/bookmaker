<h2>Power, Cooling and network hardware</h2>
<p>OK, I have a set of servers running in my office, they throw out a great deal of heat
(a Pentium 4 CPU can run at upto 90C, although it obviously does not last long). So in essence we are running
and office full of bar heaters.</p>
<p>We therefore want to run the servers, and then take the excess heat and throw it outside the office
(environment, schemvironment !)</p>
<p>So, firstly how much electricity do i need
Then how much cooling</p>
<p>Its all down to Watts</p>
<p>1 watt is a rate of power consumption equal to 1 joule per second</p>
<p>Q.      How do I convert Kilowatts (kW) into British thermal unit (Btu)?
A.      To convert Kilowatts (kW) into a British thermal unit (Btu) value simply multiply the Kilowatts value by 3414</p>
<p>kW x 3414 = Btu</p>
<p>OR from wikipedia</p>
<p>1 watt is approximately 3.41 BTU/h
(presumably they mean 1 watt hour is about 3.41 BTU hours)</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>on average a single server will consume 60-120W (yes that is a big varience, but dual cores and load all make a difference.</dt>
<dd>Measure it using a kill-a-watt meter for ease)</dd>
</dl>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: WARNING/2 (<tt class="docutils">&lt;string&gt;</tt>, line 40)</p>
Definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.</div>
<p>.</p>
<p>so, 120 W = 120*3.41 = 409 BTU for a single server
So, 15 servers, all running at once will pump out about 9000 BTU
9000 BTU is the bottom end rating for a DIY air conditioner.
Do  you see where we are going</p>
<p>So if I have a 6000 BTU rated air conditioner I can in theory have 30 servers on at full blast and
the temperature will stay the same</p>
<p>Of course that is not what we want.</p>

<div class="section" id="power">
<h2>power</h2>
<p>In UK electrical power is transmitted to your office in a 3 phase system - the three phases being
&quot;like&quot; sine waves, each of the three is 120 degrees out of step with the other (360 degrees in toto)</p>
<p>that is 3 wires, one at 0 degrees, one at 120, one at 240 degrees.</p>
<p>This means that for every 1/3 of the period over which power is delivered, there is something
deliveirng peak power.</p>

<p>Measure it - buy a plug in kill-a-watt meter

Hello. Do come in. Please take a seat and have a look around.
My name is Paul Brian and this is my online home.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>Whats all this?</h2>
This site is a guide to running an IT department or team.  It about the stuff that you should obviously know, (but can't quite get) like setting up spam filters on mail servers.  Its also about the opinions and attitudes you need, why project management is hard, and why you must read code.  And its about other people in the industry, interviews and feedback.
<p>The examples are all aimed at FreeBSD servers, a solid, dependable OS that can be found in many high end server farms.


<h2><a href="/Introduction/introduction.html">IT matters</a></h2>
It is a cliche but, computing is going to change the world. And it will take skilled and determined people at the highest reaches of companies and institutions to make that change create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.  I call those people <em>IT Managers</em>.   

<h2><a href="/SoHoFromScratch/index.html">SoHo From Scratch</a></h2>
<em>Every</em> IT manager <em>should</em> be able to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office Network, in the same way every chef should be able to prepare a 3 course meal.  The fact that many people called IT managers cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.  This area is the more traditional "how to" - a collection of recipies if you will.


<h2><a href="/Attitude/index.html">Beyond Recipies</a></h2>
Not everything is about configuring systems. Most of the job is configuring people, and the <em>trade secrets</em> of IT management.  I give my opinions on everything from project management to out-greening the competition. The youngsters round 'ere think I am a dinosaur.  


<h2><a href="/OtherPoV/index.html">Other Points of View</a></h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
