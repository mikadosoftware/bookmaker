--------
Develop the book site production process.
I want to convert rst to HTML, and return a page object, containing the various parts.

Having done that we produce HTML pages for each section, and an index.
I think it is worth having an object tracking where each page is being put / created

So this means having a root concept

/path/to/rst/
/path/to/rst/subsection/foo.chp

I want to store everything with ref to .../subsection etc

get git working with paul-brian as master/origin




- panda-py
- fabforce5
- thebook

Getting paulbrian to be a reasonably defensible 'name' in IT mgmt/CIO
getting to know which agencies / people deal with > 75K
 - screenscraper, which looks at job ads, which grabs those > 75K 
   which then outputs who is the agent responsible.



ToDO
----

1. create a tab menu at the top - stuff the idea of contents.html,
   have the contents as drop list at top... maybe

2. have contents properly labelled

3. have a index.html for each folder

4.
