Workstation
===========

THis is how I build my workstation and hopefully keep it all up todate

1. intial build
2. ports auto builder
3. keeping ports and source uptodate
4. other code
5. python


MySQL-QUery-browser
-------------------
download the source tarball from mysql.com, then run configure
I obviously require GNOME...
x11/gnome2-lite/

thius seems to require me to build
/usr/ports/sysutils/libcdio
first and seperate - perhaps not in port descrt


ok - goto /var/db/ports/gvfs, kill the options file (or amend it) and rerun config
and do not have cdda support (which requires libcdio which does not work)



choosing a Xterm
----------------
start with a comprehensive comparison

go with eterm or gnometerminal

mysql-wrapping issue ...
