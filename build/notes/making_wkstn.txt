OK this is how to build a FreeBSD server or workstation

0. Install from CD

Boot from CD.
pbrian home notes: my router has DNS cacheing problems (ie it will pass a dns request to external server and then 
see the result come back not from router but from the ext DNS, so my client ignores it)
solutions: use DHCP to acquire IP (I think router gets upset if set own )
then use passive FTP to download the files from Freebsd servers

Do a minimal install.

1. cvsup-without-gui

2. then run the cvsup (I can also untar the port and src tarball first to make things faster)

3. build files

4. package maker




1. Install, basics of the builds, port updating, etc.

- recompile kernel

0. Install from CD
