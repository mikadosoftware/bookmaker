tr -d '\015' filename

There's other ways to delete control-m besides embedding ^M:

1) Using tr:

tr -d '\015' filename

2) Using sed:

sed 's/'"$(printf '\015')"'$//g' filename


Hi..to remove ^M, give the command :
sed -e 's/^M//g' filename
you will have to write the control-M as follows : first press control-V,then control-M,this will show the correct control-M on the command line.
For removing the linefeeds,try this :
sed -e 's/.$//g' filename
this will remove the last character from the line,which happens to be the line feed.
