how to use the standard tempalte
================================

I have included a standard royalty free template from xxx
I use it as follows.

Find a suitable image from sxc.hu for use as the banner image.
alter that image to be 792x156 pixels (WxH) and saved as 

Find the main colour in that image, and look it up in a `good colour wheel <http://colorschemedesigner.com/>`_ 
and choose the complementary colours for the other parts of the template - notably change the back.png image colour and the body colour in CSS
