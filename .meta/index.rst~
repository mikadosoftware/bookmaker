Bookmaker  - Documentaionn
==========================

This is the root of documentation for Bookmaker 





Documentation 
-------------

.. toctree::
   :glob:
 
   /.doc/*
   ../_test/*   


Testing
-------

.. toctree::
   :glob:

   .test/*

   


The below seems to require a stub file (holding ::

   .. automodule:: bookmaker.mkbook
      :members:

in it, and so I can summarise on one page all my modules. 
Then link to half decent stuff on them, and reflect the package strucutre with those stubs



.. autosummary::

   bookmaker.mkbook
