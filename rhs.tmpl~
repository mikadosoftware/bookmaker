Welcome. I am Paul, your guide and editor.
Some <a href="">more about me</a>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
What is this site about. Why is it not a blog?
I think IT Management (my kind of IT management that is), really does matter. Not just for keeping the printers working but to create better, more human and more interesting places to live and work.


<h2>SoHo From Scratch</h2>
How to build and run a complete Small Office or Home Office - what *every* IT manager *should* be able to do.  The fact that many (most?) cannot is one of the reasons I have written this site.


<h2>Beyond Recipies</h2>
The other reason is to explain *why* somethings are better done in certain ways.
Its no use learning how to do something if you do not learn why - the pros and cons. Beyond Recipies is why the old ways are sometimes still the best.



<h2>Don't try this at home</h2>
A collection of interviews and commentaries from other IT Managers, trying to capture the essence of this craft, and hopefully a funny story or two.
